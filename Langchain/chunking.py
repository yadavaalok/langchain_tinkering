In each case, TypeRacer collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor's interaction with TypeRacer.

Please note that if you choose to refuse all cookies, you may not be able to use the full functionality of our Services.

How Long We Keep Your Personal Data We will only store your personal data for as long as necessary to achieve the collection purposes set out in this Privacy Notice, unless a longer retention period is required by law. If we are required by law to store your personal data beyond this period (such as for tax and commercial law reasons), we will delete the personal data at the end of this storage period. After the expiry of the aforementioned retention periods, we will delete or anonymise your personal data. To determine the appropriate retention period for personal data, we consider the amount, nature and sensitivity of the personal data, the potential risk of harm from unauthorised use and disclosure of your personal data, the purposes for which we process the personal data and the applicable legal requirements. If, after you sign up for our promotional emails, you unsubscribe from receiving our promotional emails, we will delete your personal data from our mailing lists. However, we will continue to store your email address in a blocklist to ensure that you will not receive any further communication. VI. How We Disclose Your Personal Data At times OnePlus may make certain personal data available to other companies that are wholly or jointly controlled by us ( "Affiliates" ) and other third parties that work with OnePlus in order to provide Services to you. Your personal data will not be shared with third parties for their own independent marketing purposes. • Affiliates: Your personal data may be shared with OnePlus's Affiliates for the purpose of rendering our Services to you. If Affiliates wish to process data for a different purpose, they must first seek your consent, unless another lawful basis exists. • Service Providers and Partners: Some of our Services will be provided with the assistance of third parties. We may also share some personal data with our partners in particular so as to deliver you a better service and improve your user experience. For example, when you use the security centre app, third-party service providers are used to scan for viruses and free up storage space on your phone, and we engage third-party service providers to provide you with enhanced customer service. We may also rely on service providers to identify and serve targeted advertisements, provide email services, provide tax and accounting services, organise competitions and deliver web hosting or analytics services. Any such service providers will, through appropriate data processing agreements, be bound to only process personal data on OnePlus's behalf and under our instructions, unless such service providers act as independent controllers. • Purchasers and third parties in connection with a business transaction: Where a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy liquidation or similar action takes place, we may transfer or disclose your personal data to a limited, but necessary extent to the applicable third party. • Law enforcement, regulators and other parties for legal reasons: We may also disclose your personal data to third parties as required by law, or if we reasonably believe that such action is necessary (a) to comply with a subpoena or other legal proceedings, legal actions or government agency requests; (b) when we believe in good faith that a disclosure is necessary to comply with the law and the reasonable requests of law enforcement; (c) to protect and exercise our legal claims, rights and property; (d) to protect your rights, property or personal safety or that of others; (e) to investigate fraud and (f) to protect the security or integrity of our Services. • The public, when posted in certain public spaces: Some of our Services allow you to connect and interact with others. Your profile information or information that you post in a forum or on a blog, including personal data, will be accessible to other users or the general public by default when you create it. Such content will be accessible by the general public or the members of the Service depending on the Service used. • Otherwise with consent: We may disclose your personal data to certain other third parties with your consent. VII. How Your Personal Data Is Transferred Globally 1. We leverage our resources and servers around the world to provide Services. We have data centres in the U.S., France, Singapore, India and Indonesia, which means that in compliance with applicable laws, your personal data might be transferred to or accessed from countries or regions outside of where you use our Services. 2. Please note that different countries or regions offer different levels of data protection. This means that your personal data could be stored in a country that offers a level of protection that may, in certain instances, be less protective of your personal data than the country or region in which you are located. However, in such cases, we will take measures to ensure that the personal data we collect is processed in accordance with this Privacy Notice and applicable laws, and that your personal data is adequately protected. For example, we might ask your permission to transfer your personal data across borders, and we will implement adequate security measures (such as encryption and de-identification where feasible) and sign the necessary data transmission/sharing agreements with the recipients of your personal data prior to the transfer taking place. We will also specifically ensure that we comply with laws that require us to store data locally within a specific country or region. VIII. How We Protect Your Personal Data 1. The security of your personal data is very important to us. We have taken reasonably practical, technical and organisational measures in accordance with industry standards to protect personal data collected in connection with our Service and prevent it from accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access. However, please note that while we have taken reasonable measures to protect your personal data, no websites, Internet transmissions, computer systems or wireless connections are absolutely secure. In particular: • Where appropriate, we will de-identify your personal data to mitigate the risk that other organisations or individuals may identify you on the basis of that personal data. We may also implement full security encryption during storage and transmission to prevent your personal data from unauthorised access, use or disclosure (such as by using SSL to encrypt many Services). We regularly review practices regarding personal data collection, storage and processing (including physical security measures) to prevent unauthorised access to or tampering with our various systems and your personal data. • We only allow our employees and personnel of authorised service companies to access such personal data on a need-to-know basis, in order to process such personal data or provide relevant Services to you. These employees and external personnel are subject to strict contractual confidentiality obligations. If they fail to perform these obligations, they may be held liable and/or their relationship with OnePlus may be terminated. • When transmitting and storing special categories of personal data, we use extra security measures, such as encryption of the transmitted content. We also use technical measures to process your personal biometric information so that we only need to store essential data (such as basic parameters necessary to identify a person, but not the raw facial and fingerprint data). • We carefully select our business partners and service providers and ensure that they are sufficiently bound to protect personal data and will be subject to privacy audits and assessments. • We conduct security and privacy protection training, testing and other activities to enhance employee awareness of and proficiency in personal data protection. • We use international and industry-recognised standards to protect your personal data and actively pursue relevant security and privacy protection accreditation. • We promise not to sell personal data to any third party and guarantees the legitimate and fair use of user information only to the extent permitted by law. 2. In case of a personal data security incident, we will act in accordance with applicable law and notify you and/or the competent data protection authority
 of any such security incident where required, and take measures to mitigate any risks arising therefrom. IX. Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data 1. Subject to applicable laws in your jurisdiction, you may have specific rights regarding your personal data. This may include the following rights in particular: • The right to be informed: OnePlus is publishing this Privacy Notice to keep you informed as to how we handle your personal data and what options and rights you have regarding your personal data. • The right to access: If you wish to access your personal data, some of our Services provide an interface through which you may directly search for or access certain personal data.

After you opt out of the Program, we will delete or anonymise all data collected from your device for the Program. • Unsubscribe from marketing communications: If you no longer wish to receive marketing communications, you may unsubscribe from such communications at any time using the method provided in each promotional message. • The right to deactivate your OnePlus account.

Certain jurisdictions might entitle you to refer the complaint to the relevant regulatory authority if you are not satisfied with the response you received. 6. In principle, we do not charge a fee for responding to your reasonable request. However, for multiple and repetitive requests that exceed a reasonable limit, we may charge a reasonable fee to cover some of our costs, depending on the nature of the request. We are entitled to refuse requests in whole or in part, and we may refuse requests that are manifestly unfounded, unreasonably repetitive or that require disproportionate technical effort (for instance, requests that require the development of new systems). In addition, we may not respond to requests that directly concern significant issues of public interest or may cause serious damage to the legitimate rights and interests of you or other individuals or entities. X. How We Process Children's Personal Data 1. Our Services are mainly intended for adults. A child should not use our Services without his/her legal guardian's consent. We treat anyone less than 18 years of age (or the equivalent minimum age for full legal capacity in the relevant jurisdiction) as a child. 2. If we discover that a child's personal data has been collected, we will delete the corresponding data as soon as possible. 3. If you believe that we might have any personal data concerning a child, please contact us using the "Contact Us" section. XI. Third-Party Websites 1. OnePlus Services may contain links to third-party websites, products and services. You can choose whether to access websites or accept products and services provided by third parties or not. For example, the "Follow us" function on our official website provides links to our official social media accounts (such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn and Twitter) where you can view marketing or promotional information published by OnePlus . 2. We do not control third-party privacy and data protection policies and do not accept any responsibility or liability for such policies. At the same time, such third parties are not bound by this Privacy Notice. Therefore, before submitting personal data to third parties, we strongly recommend that you refer to the privacy protection practices of such third parties. XII. How This Privacy Notice Is Updated We reserve the right to update or modify this Privacy Notice from time to time. We will, as appropriate, send you notifications of material updates to this Privacy Notice in a form we deem appropriate and we will update the "last updated" date at the start of this Privacy Notice.
